# sync
A syncthing-like sync system to keep folders in the same computer always in sync. The folders mirror each other for the time the program is running.
Changes made in the folders while the program is not running are not checked for now.

Linux-only for now.

Both the files - watch.py and singlesync.py are needed to accomplish syncing. It does not neglect hidden files or directories for now.
Running watch.py should start the syncing mechnism in the terminal.
